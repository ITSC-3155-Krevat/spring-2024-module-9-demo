# Dylan's Event Planner
This is a simple event planner built with [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) and [TailwindCSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) (mainly [HyperUI](https://www.hyperui.dev/)) that allows users to add, view, and delete events. This is meant to be starter code to help students in learning how to test [Flask](https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/3.0.x/) applications using [pytest](https://docs.pytest.org/en/8.0.x/).

## Getting Started
To get started, you will [fork](https://docs.github.com/en/pull-requests/collaborating-with-pull-requests/working-with-forks/fork-a-repo) this repo then *clone your fork*.

Next, create your virtual environment and install the dependencies:
```
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

To run the application, use the following command:
```
flask run
# or to run with debug mode
flask run --debug
```
